an vieux jardinEOV I HAVE sat here happy in the gardensEOV Watching the still pool and the reedsEOV And the dark cloudsEOV Which the wind of the upper airEOV Tore like the green leafy boughsEOV Of the divers-hued trees of late summerEOV But though I greatly delightEOV In these and the water-liliesEOV That which sets me nighest to weepingEOV Is the rose and white colour of the smooth flag-stonesEOV And the pale yellow grassesEOV Among themEOV

THOU hast made me known to friends whom I knew not Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter I forgot that there abides the old in the new and that there also thou abidestEOV Through birth and death in this world or in others wherever thou leadest me it is thou the same the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar When one knows thee then alien there is none then no door is shut Oh grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play of the manyEOV
No more noisy loud words from me such is my master's will Henceforth I deal in whispers The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a songEOV Men hasten to the King's market All the buyers and sellers are there But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day in the thick of workEOV Let then the flowers come out in my garden though it is not their time and let the midday bees strike up their lazy humEOV Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequenceEOV
On the day when the lotus bloomed alas my mind was straying and I knew it not My basket was empty and the flower remained unheededEOV Only now and again a sadness fell upon me and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south windEOV That vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completionEOV I knew not then that it was so near that it was mine and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heartEOV
By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs and thou keepest me free Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone But day passes by after day and thou are not seenEOV If I call not thee in my prayers if I keep not thee in my heart thy love for me still waits for my loveEOV
I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother Even so in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me And because I love this life I know I shall love death as well The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left oneEOV
Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well Oh thou beautiful there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty silently to crown the earth And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds through trackless paths carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of restEOV But there where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in reigns the stainless white radiance There is no day nor night nor form nor colour and never never a wordEOV

Lo such the story of two human livesEOV To them as happens oft abundant shareEOV Of Nature's choicest gifts brought many illsEOV But noble lives are thus more noble madeEOV As shining gold oft-heated shines the moreEOV Over the ancient land of VijiaporeEOV There reigned a king for truth and valour knownEOV The lovely Chandra was his only childEOV Who like the moon among the stars of heavenEOV Shone fairest 'mong the daughters of the landEOV The father fondly hoped his child would wedEOV A neighbouring prince the mighty ruler ofEOV An ancient kingdom richer than his ownEOV The mother she would be the worthy spouseEOV Of him who was her brother's only sonEOV And trusted minister of VijiaporeEOV But one there was a courtier of the landEOV A youth yet full of counsel wise and trueEOV And ever ready to obey his master's willEOV The terror of his foes a hunter boldEOV He rode the fleetest horse with ease and graceEOV The wildest elephant his might could tameEOV And horned bulls knew well his steady gripEOV Him Chandra wished to wed and in her breastEOV With silent hope her love for him kept warmEOV The years sped on the father fondly dreamtEOV She soon would be the queen of two proud realmsEOV The mother that her future lord would beEOV Both king and minister of state MeanwhileEOV Fair Chandra and her noble TimmarajEOV Longed for the consummation of their loveEOV A flower there is the fairest flower in IndEOV A flower beloved by poets of all timeEOV Whose beauties lovers ever love to tellEOV And liken oft to woman's thousand charmsEOV This flower the stately lotus of our IndEOV Its petals closes to the moon at eveEOV And all its beauties hides through silent nightEOV But with the rising of the morning sunEOV Opens and swells its beauty full displaysEOV And sweetest fragrance breathes when fiercest beatEOV The rays E'en so fair Chandra though oft toldEOV She womanhood had long ago attainedEOV And soon must wed one worthy of her raceEOV Nought heeded when alternate to her viewEOV Were brought the prowess of the neighbouring kingEOV The wisdom of the pilot of the stateEOV To wean her love from noble TimmarajEOV He forth was sent against his country's foesEOV With his small band to fall and ne'er returnEOV But oft as he was sent as often heEOV Returned victorious with fresh laurels gainedEOV And when the bards before the king and queenEOV Recited in the ancient palace hallEOV The battles bravely won the glories ofEOV The war fair Chandra's face with joy e'en likeEOV The lotus beamed and as by magic charmedEOV Disclosed a thousand beauties centred thereEOV Though silent she her looks to all made knownEOV Her love for Timmaraj the author braveEOV Of all his country's good Yet still she keptEOV A seal upon her lips until by chanceEOV An incident occurred which sealed her fateEOV As on the sand near by the water's edgeEOV One thoughtless stands to watch with eager eyesEOV The surf that beats continuous on the shoreEOV And suddenly when least expected flowsEOV A wave that reaches far beyond the restEOV So stood the king and queen of VijiaporeEOV In parents' place tempting their daughter fairEOV To marry whom she loved not could not loveEOV When Chandra suddenly her mind declaredEOV Down through the stillness of a narrow valeEOV The lovely Pampa flows whose course is shapedEOV By hills that lift their summits to the skyEOV On either side her course is like the lifeEOV Inconstant of the daughters of this landEOV Who lived in times of old in castles setEOV Amidst rich groves and cool pellucid streamsEOV And woodlands broad and fair to roam at willEOV But these by moats and battlements enclosedEOV Were made impassable that the eyes impureEOV Of man might not upon their beauty gazeEOV And so defile their virgin purityEOV For all that here delighted woman's eyesEOV Was freely lavished by their royal siresEOV And countless guards to watch all day were thereEOV And maidens numberless to sport with themEOV And while away their tedious hours of lifeEOV With tales of youth who bolder than the restEOV Leapt over moats and scaled steep battlementsEOV To have a glimpse of those more dear than lifeEOV But who alas were doomed to endless woeEOV And sent to pine away in dungeons darkEOV For tainting with their feet forbidden groundEOV But soon their life was changed the royal brideEOV Before the happy bridal hour beganEOV Was first by all her kindred freely seenEOV And straightway taken to the palace hallEOV To choose and then make known her future lordEOV From anxious suitors there and thenceforth spendEOV With him her days of freedom and of joyEOV E'en so none dared so fearful is the gorgeEOV To gaze upon the river's lovelinessEOV Except those inmates of the mountain cavesEOV That in the noontide hour to quench their thirstEOV Climb down regardless of the huntsman's bowEOV Or save the vultures of the air those birdsEOV Which soaring on majestic wings aloftEOV Alight as if by instinct drawn uponEOV Her shady margins there to feast uponEOV The carcass of some beast that died of ageEOV But soon the valley widens and she flowsEOV At will her waters sparkle in the sunEOV And on her margins for grim hills are seenEOV Green fields deep shady groves and peaceful homesEOV 'Tis here those mountains that kept zealous guardEOV O'er Pampa fade away from view as ifEOV To make amends for past unkindlinessEOV So leaving her to shoot into the plainEOV And watering Vijiapore and countless landsEOV 'Twas here the village stood of ChengalporeEOV The scene of many noble deeds of manEOV And woman's high devotion to her lordEOV 'Twas here one crowded hour of Timma's lifeEOV Was worth his country's brightest annals richEOV In spoils of war and deeds of valiant menEOV In that one hour of all his glorious lifeEOV He won a kingdom and a bride for whomEOV He left that kingdom never to returnEOV And this the story of that glorious hourEOV One day the news to Vijiapore was broughtEOV The elephant whose rich caparisoned backEOV The king to please his subjects once a yearEOV Rode on his keeper in a sudden fitEOV Of frenzy killed and dreadful havoc wroughtEOV Amongst the royal steeds in ChengalporeEOV And now the mandate from the king went forthEOV That Timmaraj should slay his fav'rite beastEOV For e'en the stoutest warrior of the landEOV Dared not approach him in his frenzied moodEOV Then 'twas that Chandra suddenly her mindEOV Declared and boldly spake in words like theseEOV It is not meet dear father that thou shouldstEOV So lightly use our only warrior's lifeEOV Who won so many battles for his kingEOV And added nought but glory and renownEOV Unto his country and bid him thus flingEOV His life away before a beast insaneEOV Thou knowest well thy foes are ever bentEOV On wresting from thine hands this ancient crownEOV And he alone it is that often curbsEOV Their pride Yes Timmaraj shall slay the beastEOV But grant my pray'r that he shall marry meEOV For often hast thou said that womanhoodEOV I long ago attained and soon should wedEOV One therefore worthy of our ancient houseEOV And gladly will I wed that warrior boldEOV That shall before tomorrow's sun has setEOV Unto the portals of thy palace hereEOV Bring dead the beast that now at ChengalporeEOV Is working havoc on thy noble steedsEOV The king to this his consent gladly gaveEOV Assured that Timma by the angry beastEOV Would be destroyed and never would returnEOV And so the second mandate was proclaimedEOV And sent to Chandra's other suitors tooEOV That he shall win the daughter of the kingEOV Who slays the beast before the morrow's closeEOV The morrow came and ere the warrior youthEOV Leapt on his faithful steed at early mornEOV A maiden stood before his gate and saidEOV Brave youth thy Chandra sent me here to sayEOV Thou shouldst not fear to boldly face the beastEOV Shouldst thou come victor back she will be thineEOV And thine for ever even after deathEOV But shouldst thou flee from him to save thy lifeEOV Think then thou art unworthy of her loveEOV And she shall not e'en see thy coward faceEOV But if perchance thou fallest by the beastEOV Vouchsafe to her through me with thine own handEOV One javelin of the eight which now thou hastEOV For she will not outlive her TimmarajEOV But straightway bare her breast and plunge the dartEOV And lifeless fall a corpse The youth repliedEOV I gladly send this javelin but tell herEOV She shall not need its use for TimmarajEOV Will surely come victorious with the beastEOV With javelins seven then he sallied forthEOV Upon his steed to win his bride or dieEOV Meanwhile the news was spread that TimmarajEOV And that young min'ster who these many yearsEOV Was seeking through her mother Chandra's handEOV And Bukka ruler of the neighbouring stateEOV Whom she her father fondly wished should wedEOV Had started on their steeds to ChengalporeEOV Each vowed to be the first to drag the beastEOV Unto the royal city for six milesEOV And there slay him before the palace gateEOV The city poured her sons the sight to seeEOV For in the annals of their country's pastEOV Not e'en the brightest page contained one deedEOV That could this glorious feat of man surpassEOV And Timma was the people's fav'rite andEOV They dearly wished that he should slay the beastEOV Win Chandra and become their future kingEOV But soon the thought of that mad beast unnervedEOV Both Bukka and the minister of the stateEOV The royal Bukka thus to himself saidEOV A richer kingdom than this VijiaporeEOV I own and why should I now madly stakeEOV My life in this hard feat 'tis easier farEOV To gain this Chandra and her father's throneEOV I will sit hidden in the thickest bushEOV Near yonder stream by which the pathway runsEOV For Timmaraj is sure to pass that wayEOV And with this arrow I will end his lifeEOV Thereafter Chandra's love for him will fadeEOV And die and who is there to marry herEOV But I So thought this foolish youth to whomEOV A woman's love was as inconstant asEOV His own resolve to fight a savage beastEOV And sat within a bush to watch his preyEOV He too the pilot of the state deemed itEOV A mad resolve to try the dang'rous featEOV And silent sat unnoticed and unknownEOV Upon the other side of that same pathEOV Within a secret bush by that same streamEOV The one knew not the other was concealedEOV The fatal blow upon the selfsame preyEOV To deal but fearless Timma on his horseEOV Approached the beast which madly rushed on themEOV To force both horse and rider to the groundEOV With his huge leg and then to tear them bothEOV The horse was fleeter than the elephantEOV Which thus the chase gave up but still the youthEOV Undaunted neared the beast a second timeEOV And hurled with all his might a jav'lin whichEOV Pierced deep the temple Thus enraged the beastEOV Began the chase again but still the steedEOV Was fleeter than the wearied elephantEOV And once again he stopped but Timma hurledEOV A second which went deeper than the firstEOV And roused him all the more and nevermoreEOV He stopped but towards Vijiapore the chaseEOV Continued for in due succession flewEOV Six jav'lins lightning-like with deadly aimEOV Thus by the angry beast pursued he nearedEOV At last the little stream that must perforceEOV Be crossed to reach the royal city gateEOV Then from the pouch that dangled on his backEOV His only jav'lin with his utmost mightEOV Discharged that so enraged the maddened beastEOV With fury rushing that his writhing trunkEOV Had all but touched the rider and his horseEOV In one embrace to crush them both but soonEOV The keen-eyed youth the danger saw and spurredEOV His horse which bounded o'er the stream when loEOV Two arrows crossed each other underneathEOV One pierced the min'ster dead the other piercedEOV The royal Bukka who unconscious fellEOV One moment more and at the palace gateEOV The wearied rider on his foaming steedEOV Stood like a warrior coming with his spoilsEOV The beast beside him which worn out fell deadEOV And as the tall and massive gate of someEOV Old fort with spikes deep driven to withstandEOV The foe who battered it incessant fallsEOV And powerless to stand the shock at lastEOV Falls with a crash that far and wide was heardEOV So fell the beast his massive corpse all tornEOV And mangled and with jav'lins planted deepEOV And when he fell from his huge throat went forthEOV A wail his last like roaring thunder thatEOV Resounded through the hills of VijiaporeEOV Another moment and brave Timma satEOV Upon the bridal seat the veil was drawnEOV And through the veil the sacred knot was tiedEOV Round Chandra's neck and all was merry thereEOV And still another moment when alasEOV For that strange fickleness of human lifeEOV Whose joys and griefs each other follow likeEOV The spokes of some fast-going wheel there cameEOV The wounded Bukka with a violent wailEOV That Timma had the king's adviser slainEOV Whose body lay upon the riversideEOV Exposed to all the carrion birds of preyEOV And him too wounded but the arrow piercedEOV Not deep but laid him senseless for awhileEOV But soon with consciousness restored his woundEOV He washed and straightway hastened on his steedEOV In time to tell the story sad but trueEOV And stop the marriage of that coward withEOV The fairest and the noblest of the landEOV As when upon a tree whose boughs with fruitsEOV Are laden birds innumerable sitEOV Them to enjoy and to be merry thereEOV The cruel hand of man to mar their joysEOV Hurls suddenly a stone and all the airEOV Around is thick with jarring sounds of birdsEOV That in confusion fly so fell the wordsEOV Of Bukka on that scene where all was joyEOV Where like a beehive swarmed the surging crowdEOV To see the marriage of their princess dearEOV And straightway in confusion wild they ranEOV Without a purpose but in various waysEOV Unto their homes some ran the news t'acquaintEOV Some to the wounded Bukka and his horseEOV But many to the riverside to findEOV Their min'ster lying dead by arrow piercedEOV The sorrow-stricken king spake not a wordEOV But like a lifeless figure stood awhileEOV A sudden fit of frenzy overtookEOV The king at last and Timma's awful doomEOV He thundered forth in accents strong like theseEOV Be this my decree forthwith known to allEOV That Timma henceforth shall be banished fromEOV My land for this dishonour brought on meEOV He paved his way by murder to my throneEOV And sullied the fair name of my dear houseEOV When these few awful words the monarch spokeEOV Tears trickled down his eyes and Timma fromEOV The bridal seat received his doom 'stead ofEOV A blessing from the father of his brideEOV A gentle touch a whisper through the veilEOV Then Timma to the royal judgment bowedEOV And slowly moved from out those scenes of joyEOV And merriment and reached the palace gateEOV Where stood his horse by that dead elephantEOV And soon in that confusion that prevailedEOV Was seen to slowly move a figure veiledEOV T'approach the gate and forthwith Timma swungEOV That figure on the saddle of his horseEOV Then himself leapt and vanished straight from viewEOV The angry monarch saw their sudden flightEOV And as some agèd lion when sore vexedEOV Like thunder roaring musters all his strengthEOV And stands defiant to face the foe so stoodEOV The agèd warrior whose old strength returnedEOV His breast expanded and his body raisedEOV Erect and for the time his age shook offEOV Then spake he forth in angry tones like theseEOV My only child is gone and he that bringsEOV My daughter back shall have my highest meedEOV Nay even half my kingdom I will giveEOV None dared save Bukka to essay the featEOV Who forthwith sprang upon his horse and soonEOV O'ertook the running pair for Timma's horseEOV Though deemed the fleetest in the land now feltEOV His double weight his wonted speed decreasedEOV Then Timma said Our foe is nearing fastEOV And he is armed while weapons I have noneEOV In bridal dress I cannot face the foeEOV And he will sure kill me and take you backEOV Unto your angry sire Thou art a girlEOV Born of the martial Kshatriya race and henceEOV Thou knowest well to ride the wildest horseEOV So let me now dismount for thee t'escapeEOV 'Tis better far I die with thee she saidEOV But I have here the javelin thou didst giveEOV Before thou went'st to kill the elephantEOV The eighth and last concealed within my veilEOV Take this and stop the coming foe but ohEOV Kill not the wretch who dared to follow usEOV And sully this our happy bridal hourEOV By murder only stay oh stay the chaseEOV So said she gave the jav'lin which he hurledEOV Upon the chasing charger's breast with allEOV His might and straightway horse and rider fellEOV And like those innocent and helpless dovesEOV The loving pair together fled awayEOV Their life of joy and freedom to renewEOV Before the fury of an angered kingEOV For full three days and nights they ran and foundEOV At last a safe and happy shelter inEOV A shepherd's cot and in those troublous timesEOV 'Twas easier for the brave to kingdoms foundEOV Rear palaces and rulers strong becomeEOV Than for the toiling peasants from sown fieldsEOV To reap their crops and safely bear them homeEOV Brave Timma was a stranger 'mongst new menEOV The many tigers by his arrows killedEOV And neighbouring clans and lawless robbers keptEOV In check gave them sure hopes of future peaceEOV And future joy and straightway they made himEOV Their king to guard their women and their homesEOV While they their avocations of the soilEOV In peace pursued and soon was raised a fortEOV A stately palace too was reared withinEOV By willing hands and safe from dang'rous foesEOV And far away from their dear native valeEOV Of Vijiapore they spent their peaceful daysEOV In joy beloved by all their loyal menEOV But 'tis a saying often told in IndEOV He hath a foe who hath a lovely wifeEOV Her very loveliness is reason deemedEOV To hate her lord nay murder him and henceEOV Her husband's foe unconscious she becomesEOV For Chandra's beauty all these evils wroughtEOV Upon the youth who for his country foughtEOV So many battles and the Moslem keptEOV In constant dread and for his virtue's sakeEOV Though most beloved in his native landEOV And dreaded most for valour by his foesEOV He lived a stranger in a foreign landEOV She too that maiden 'twas her fate to shareEOV Her husband's troubles for her beauty rareEOV Still 'twas a little heav'n their new home whereEOV The halcyon days of mutual love were spentEOV 'Tis sweet to love and sweeter to be lovedEOV And thus in their new home their life of joyEOV They spent in undisturbèd solitudeEOV But ah this even was not long to beEOV One day the news was brought to their new kingEOV By a small troop of sorrow-stricken menEOV That ev'ry night a tiger from his denEOV Came down and fearful havoc wrought amongstEOV Their toiling cattle and the piteous talesEOV Of dreadful woe they poured into his earEOV Moved Timma's heart who took his trusty bowEOV And forthwith started with a faithful bandEOV To drag the tiger from his mountain caveEOV And then for ever stop his mad careerEOV For days and nights he wandered in the woodsEOV But sad to tell found not the dreaded beastEOV Still nothing daunted continued the searchEOV Until at last his faithful men he missedEOV And wandered far into the wilds unknownEOV When lo the villain Bukka who uponEOV The outskirts of the newly-founded stateEOV Was hovering like a falcon o'er his preyEOV Pounced suddenly upon the lonely youthEOV And safely carried him to his abodeEOV Then tidings sent to Chandra in these wordsEOV Dear maid thy Timma is a helpless slaveEOV A humble suppliant for his life beforeEOV The valiant Bukka let thy pride now ceaseEOV The jav'lin which thou sentest me to slayEOV Which killed my noble steed instead awaitsEOV To pierce his head and forthwith end his lifeEOV But hearken ere I strike him dead therewithEOV Thy matchless beauty valour virtue theseEOV Are fit to shine in royal courts like mineEOV Add splendour to my household where installedEOV As queen the daughters of my land will payEOV Homage to thee discard him therefore andEOV Love me and I will forthwith set him freeEOV The angry maiden made reply Vile wretchEOV Cursed be thy head to hold this evil thoughtEOV If in my presence this request were madeEOV Sure I to fragments would have splintered itEOV With my own weapon and the pieces thrownEOV To carrion birds to feast upon withalEOV Tell him 'tis better far he should be likeEOV A cur tied at my gate for servants asEOV They pass to throw a little morsel fromEOV The remnants of our feast I fear him notEOV And if my lord he kills sure I am notEOV His wife if forthwith I don't leap uponEOV The flames and then to ashes be reducedEOV Begone 'twere better far my husband diesEOV Than be the prisoner of a grovelling wretchEOV Bukka whose ire was roused sent word at lastEOV Beware you foolish maid poor Timma's lifeEOV Endanger not by this refusal sternEOV Nor lightly treat my prowess for to meEOV 'Tis easier far to take away his lifeEOV Than for the lordly monarch of the woodsEOV To kill the puny weakly lamb and noughtEOV Prompts me to wait thus far but pity forEOV The daughter of a friend and neighbour-kingEOV Else Timma's body would have long ere thisEOV Been given to the eagles of the airEOV So listen now once more ere I kill himEOV And if at all thou carest for his lifeEOV Let me but see the beauty of thy faceEOV And for one moment only gaze uponEOV Its loveliness then Timma shall be freeEOV And I will pass in quietness to my homeEOV Nay henceforth I will not molest you bothEOV Shouldst thou this last request refuse I swearEOV By all I sacred hold the moment thatEOV Refusal comes the jav'lin from my handEOV Will fly at Timma and will strike him deadEOV Meantime brave Chandra in the audience hallEOV Of her own palace 'midst her faithful menEOV Received the news and then in angry tonesEOV She spurned the wild request when there appearedEOV Her priest who counsel gave in words like theseEOV It is not meet O royal lady thatEOV Thou shouldst this attitude defiant assumeEOV When Bukka in a moment may bereaveEOV Us all of our dear noble TimmarajEOV And drive thee too to fling thy life awayEOV And if 'tis writ thou shouldst so die with himEOV Our sad entreaties and our tears will noughtEOV Avail nor alter laws thus preordainedEOV But haply if it is writ otherwiseEOV Why break the link that binds you both for lifeEOV Call it not chance the link that binds men's heartsEOV But Heaven's sacred gift to sweeten lifeEOV It is the hand divine that guides man's lifeEOV From the inception to the very endEOV Nay more sees even after that life's endEOV Its own appointed destiny is reachedEOV To take fresh shape its course to run anewEOV And reap what it had sown before for takeEOV The tree its fruit but falls to reach its baseEOV The calf his mother easily doth findEOV Amidst a thousand cows to suck the milkEOV And all our deeds doth likewise follow usEOV E'en after death and they are not our ownEOV But preordainèd laws that must perforceEOV Be anywise fulfilled and He aloneEOV It is that sees their strict fulfilment hereEOV For ah why should the noblest maiden andEOV The fairest and the wisest in the landEOV Be mated to the meanest wretch through lifeEOV All that is deemed the highest in the worldEOV Beauty and honour valour virtue wealthEOV All these availeth not her mind is blankEOV She herself knows not whom to love and wedEOV Not e'en dear friendship kindles in her breastEOV The lamp of love but suddenlyEOV A passing stranger's glance a simple lookEOV Instinctive plants that love which slow takes shapeEOV Despite a thousand counter forces tillEOV At last the final end is reached a lookEOV Is thus enough to bind two hearts for lifeEOV And this is but the true fulfilment ofEOV A preordainèd law that in the lifeEOV Before had all but reached perfection fullEOV Or their appointed shape had all but tak'nEOV And in the new life easily attainsEOV The end such then the truth of all such thingsEOV Call it what you will simple tendencyEOV Inherited the least sign gives it lifeEOV Which but leads it to its appointed endEOV Like powder whose combustibleness sleepsEOV The sudden spark to action rouses itEOV And thus it was O Chandra thou didst shareEOV A humble courtier's lot and didst refuseEOV The premier noble's hand or better stillEOV The queenship of two mighty states and thusEOV The many counter forces that were setEOV At work but strengthened thy true love for himEOV And why endanger such a husband's lifeEOV One wedded so to thee and not by chanceEOV But by the preordainèd law of GodEOV For know thou livest only for thy lordEOV Thy husband is thy lord and if perchanceEOV It is his will thou shouldst be Bukka's queenEOV Thou shouldst so knowing it obey his willEOV Else sure thou shalt be deemed nor pure nor chasteEOV But counted worse than e'en a faithless wifeEOV 'Tis not in man to alter written lawsEOV 'Tis hard nay useless too to fight 'gainst fateEOV And if 'tis writ that Bukka should now seeEOV Thy matchless face thou canst not alter itEOV And fate's severities good deeds aloneEOV Can soften and our holy writings sayEOV 'Tis sin to let another man beholdEOV Thy face admire the beauties that enchantEOV And thou becomest then impure but thoseEOV Same holy books say 'tis no sin to seeEOV The shadow for the true realityEOV Now therefore let a silken veil be drawnEOV And underneath a bowl of oil be placedEOV And the reflection of thy face thereinEOV Let Bukka see and Timmaraj be savedEOV To this the queen consent unwilling gaveEOV And Bukka to the palace gladly cameEOV Resolved to freedom give to TimmarajEOV If Chandra were like other maidens fairEOV But sure possess her if she shone amongEOV The daughters of the earth surpassing fairEOV And like the moon among the stars of heav'nEOV The veil was drawn the bowl of oil was placedEOV And lo was seen therein a face whose likeEOV The royal Bukka ne'er had seen beforeEOV In all his life like lightning it appearedEOV Bright'ning the surface for an instant andEOV Like lightning vanished planting in his breastEOV Impassioned love for Chandra and a loveEOV Too deeply rooted to be rooted outEOV Then Chandra through the screen impatient saidEOV Now that this deed is done delay no moreEOV My long lost husband to restore to meEOV And Bukka made reply O maiden fairEOV O Chandra I am smitten by thy charmsEOV Thy wondrous face is ever in my mindEOV And nought can now induce me to restoreEOV Thy Timmaraj to thee to gaze uponEOV Thy wondrous beauty and enjoy those charmsEOV My kingdom broad is at thy feet and thereEOV Enthroned as queen my riches and my allEOV Shall be at thy command and therefore hearEOV If by tomorrow eve thou dost not reachEOV My tent pitched yonder Timmaraj shall dieEOV And to the pyre if thou dost follow himEOV Sure I will myself die with thee and thusEOV A double sin will rest upon thy headEOV As the fond mother of an only childEOV When sick clings closely to it and for daysEOV And nights incessant watches it with careEOV When he well versed in all the healing loreEOV Gives but to please her hopes of cure completeEOV But suddenly the dang'rous maladyEOV New shape assumes the symptoms serious growEOV The healer himself breaks at last the newsEOV Unto the anxious mother who stands muteEOV And knows not what to do in blank despairEOV So felt the hapless Chandra when these wordsEOV The treach'rous Bukka spake and left the sceneEOV Now 'twas her holy Brahmin priest appearedEOV And counsel gave again in words like theseEOV Grieve not but well rejoice that Bukka buildsEOV His future hope on base dishonestyEOV His fall is near and Timma's safe returnEOV Henceforth is sure for he that hopes to winEOV By treach'ry and deceit fails sorely inEOV This world of God and therefore fear him notEOV It is the foe magnan'mous thou shouldst fearEOV Our holy ancient writings say it isEOV No sin deceit to conquer by deceitEOV And hence fail not to send immediate wordEOV That Bukka should tomorrow eve expectEOV Thee as befits a woman of thy rankEOV And with a hundred maidens in his tentEOV Take twenty litters and let one appearEOV More gorgeous than the rest for thee to sitEOV Take but a hundred of thy faithful menEOV All armed to fight for their dear king and queenEOV Thou art a kshatriya girl thou knowest wellEOV To fight and therefore take thy fav'rite bowEOV And arrows and conceal thy person withEOV A maiden's veil armed fully as thou artEOV And likewise let thy men be covered tooEOV To look like thine own maids of honour letEOV Each litter with a man inside be borneEOV By four go forth equipped likewise surpriseEOV The foe bring him a prisoner or uponEOV The field of battle die a noble deathEOV And death need have no horrors unto theeEOV But unto those to whom this world is brightEOV Its prospects hopeful and its pleasures keenEOV And to the healthy and the young death's pangsEOV Are most severe when life is plucked and fromEOV Sere age when all is ready for the endEOV Life unperceived goes as from one that sleepsEOV The gentlest wind brings down the serest leafEOV To sever from the parent stem by forceEOV The freshest must be plucked and so with manEOV And by the righteous and the just when soreEOV Oppressed with grief dear death is welcomed mostEOV When the eruptions on the skin pain mostEOV By cutting them relief at once is soughtEOV E'en so if noble Timmaraj is killedEOV Court instant death thy dagger hurl and bareEOV Thy breast and lifeless by thy husband fallEOV Like that same bird that full up to the throatEOV Swallows the little pebbles of the sandEOV And soaring high aloft upon her wingsEOV Suddenly closes them and drops down deadEOV Near her dead lover where the body burstsEOV But this if you find hard run with thy lifeEOV To this our safe abode where willinglyEOV The fun'ral pyre we with our hands will raiseEOV And feed the flames thy body to consumeEOV Hence soon depart and Krishna will help theeEOV The morrow came and Chandra sallied forthEOV And as directed by her Brahmin sageEOV Went with a hundred of her armèd menEOV All veiled surprised the foe who flushed with hopeEOV Unguarded waited but to welcome herEOV Then safely rescued her lost TimmarajEOV The fatal jav'lin wrung from Bukka's handsEOV And himself too a prisoner brought in chainsEOV Then in the spacious palace hall amidstEOV Her faithful men the noble queen sat veiledEOV With Timmaraj long absent from the throneEOV And spake to Bukka standing in the frontEOV With folded hands in angry words like theseEOV By treach'ry thrice thou triedst to win and thriceEOV Hast failed and when my noble TimmarajEOV Went singly forth to bring the maddened beastEOV Concealed thou didst aim at his life and failedEOV The hand of God had otherwise decreedEOV And when upon the bridal seat we satEOV And all were merry in my father's homeEOV Thou camest with a story false and baseEOV And for our lives we had to flee and nowEOV Are strangers here and when upon thy steedEOV Unjustly thou pursuedst us both it wasEOV My hand that stayed my husband killing theeEOV Else long ago the worms had eaten theeEOV Thy bones the jackals of the earth had tak'nEOV And nothing left of thee but thine own sinsEOV It was thy charger innocent that paidEOV For them the penalty instead Once moreEOV You came and like a lawless thief concealedEOV Carried my lord when helpless and aloneEOV And for his freedom vile proposals madeEOV And for so many days these troubles wroughtEOV On me and these my faithful loyal menEOV Know well 'tis virtue that is sure to winEOV And truth and justice will prevail at lastEOV This very jav'lin will put thine eyes outEOV But pity for thy present state prompts meEOV To let thee now alone go safely homeEOV And henceforth never even sin in thoughtEOV And like a criminal who by pity freedEOV At once goes forth worse sins to perpetrateEOV So Bukka vowing vengeance left the hallEOV And henceforth love and hate alternate playedEOV In his dark breast hate for this grave insultEOV And by a woman offered and love tooEOV A bestial passion for her wondrous charmsEOV And from that selfsame moment various plansEOV His head devised her pride to humble andEOV Her purity to sully when alasEOV The Moslems' greed of power gave him sure hopesEOV At last her Timma's ruin to completeEOV Unto the agèd king of VijiaporeEOV His only warrior's and his only child'sEOV Escape brought many toils and endless woeEOV That Bukka with a perjured tale came onEOV The day of marriage was made known to allEOV Soon after they had left their native homeEOV The agèd monarch knew not where they livedEOV But sent his faithful servants far and wideEOV To bring them home the cruel Moslems tooEOV Aware that Timma's absence weakened himEOV Combined a sudden rush to make uponEOV The royal city kill her ruler andEOV Divide the spoils and take his vast domainsEOV And now the wily Bukka with those foesEOV Of foreign faith conspired what though he foughtEOV As usual in the ranks of VijiaporeEOV Under the banner of her Hindu kingEOV To them he would run in the thickest ofEOV The fight and sudden turn the tide of warEOV And from the conquered spoils for his own shareEOV He wanted neither lands nor riches butEOV Demanded Chandra and her lord aliveEOV And news of instant war had travelled farEOV And wide the princes and the chieftains pouredEOV Their loyal forces ready to avengeEOV Their Moslem foes who for no cause thus daredEOV Their city to invade so suddenlyEOV And Timma hastened with his wife at lastEOV And was with joy received by all who lostEOV All hopes of ever seeing them aliveEOV And soon a council in the royal hallEOV Was held to name a leader and decideEOV How best to strike at once th' advancing foesEOV Many felt proud by Timma to be ledEOV To victory in the field or glorious deathEOV And many too in that assembly saidEOV That Bukka should not join their Hindu ranksEOV For he would in the midst of battle joinEOV The Moslem ranks and surely bring defeatEOV And ruin too upon their agèd kingEOV The noble Ramaraj of VijiaporeEOV And cause their ancient kingdom's overthrowEOV But said one counted high for wisdom thereEOV Do good and so chide him that evil doesEOV Is the oft-quoted saying of our trueEOV And ancient faith and this is but the warEOV For mastery 'tween different creeds and faithsEOV And hence let Bukka forthwith come to fightEOV Against the common foes who thus combinedEOV To mar our ancient faith and change our livesEOV And let our Ramaraj himself go forthEOV And lead and everlasting glory winEOV And in defence of our old Hindu faithEOV Or if he falls let him to Swarga goEOV To join th' immortals there and one word moreEOV To thee O Timma bury all the pastEOV And Bukka for his sins forgive and bothEOV Go hand in hand to fight the Moslem foesEOV To pardon is the spirit of our faithEOV To this consent was gladly giv'n by allEOV And the propitious day and hour to marchEOV Was soon named by the holy Brahmin priestEOV So deeply versed in all the starry loreEOV Brave Timma sought his anxious wife ere heEOV Went forth to fight and thus took leave of herEOV Dear wife the day to march is named at lastEOV Your agèd sire and our dear monarch leadsEOV The war and Bukka as a Hindu trueEOV Joins us to fight against the Moslem hordeEOV And doubly glad I am that in this warEOV With Bukka vying in the field with meEOV And in the very presence of our kingEOV Who well rewards the val'rous and the braveEOV The place of honour I will there attainEOV For courage true and prove once more beforeEOV The world I am a worthy husband ofEOV A noble wife so let me now departEOV She made reply Some evil it forebodesEOV That Bukkaraj should thus be madly toldEOV To join our ranks for what is truth and GodEOV To one so steeped in sin And sad it isEOV My agèd father goes with him to fightEOV Trust not in him and keep a steady eyeEOV On him e'en if within the thickest ofEOV The fight thou art for any moment heEOV May turn the tide of war fight till the lastEOV And if thou comest back victorious fromEOV The field I'll be the first to welcome theeEOV But if thou fallest fighting in the fieldEOV Or if perhaps it chances otherwiseEOV Thou art left helpless and alone here isEOV Our ever ready jav'lin to kill theeEOV Thy body forthwith shall be nobly borneEOV Unto the pyre by thine own faithful menEOV And I will gladly leap upon the flamesEOV But if thou comest routed and aliveEOV Then Chandra nevermore shall see thy faceEOV At early morn upon th' appointed dayEOV The king his faithful servants summoned andEOV Before them all his only brother namedEOV To rule the kingdom and confided allEOV His subjects to his care then at the headEOV Of his brave troops out of the city marchedEOV Amidst the royal bards recounting inEOV Sweet tones the glories of his kingdom's pastEOV His holy priests invoking Krishna's helpEOV And chanting sacred hymns and in the midstEOV Of maidens of the martial Kshatrya raceEOV Proceeding to the very city gatesEOV And singing to their fathers brothers andEOV Their husbands in shrill notes heard far and wideEOV That Swarga's gates are ever ready toEOV Receive the faithful if they bravely fallEOV The flames are ready to take their proud wivesEOV But burning hell gapes wide for to devourEOV The cowards that run routed and aliveEOV Their maidens' sweet embrace awaits them notEOV At last upon the plains of TálicótEOV The armies met fierce raged the battle andEOV Old Ramaraj fought nobly in the fieldEOV And Timma too wrought dreadful havoc onEOV The Moslems and their ranks oft shattered butEOV Alas the ever treach'rous Bukka pouncedEOV Sudden on his own ranks the king was slainEOV His ghastly head upon a pole was shownEOV And helpless and forlorn the Hindus stoodEOV But ere perfidious Bukka could run withEOV The Moslem foes to capture him aliveEOV A faithful soldier Timma called gave himEOV His Chandra's jav'lin in his steady gripEOV To hold then boldly ran his body throughEOV And instantly fell lifeless to the groundEOV A faithful few the body bore and laidEOV Before the orphaned and the widowed maidEOV Their precious charge and soon the pyre was raisedEOV Then near the flames that brightened her bright faceEOV Her uncle and her people shedding tearsEOV Her noble husband lying cold and stillEOV The story of her father's cruel deathEOV Still ringing in her ears she took farewellEOV Dear uncle and my faithful men grieve notEOV I see a cloud now looming yonder thereEOV No bigger than the hand of man that shallEOV Expand and rain and water to purge allEOV The land of th' innocent blood shed on itEOV For mother India's cup of woe is fullEOV And but three decades more there will come fromEOV The far-off ends of this vast globe of oursEOV A little island planted in the seaEOV A handful of a noble race to tradeEOV And shall from thee ask for a plot of landEOV And they shall prosper for their valour andEOV Shall be exalted for their righteousnessEOV They shall befriend the helpless and the poorEOV And like the streams that seek the ocean broadEOV The chickens that run to their mothers wingsEOV The maidens helpless and forlorn that courtEOV The succour of the chivalrous and the braveEOV The orphans poor the bounty of the kindEOV All men of Ind all races and all creedsEOV Shall to their banner flock to live in peaceEOV And amity the tiger and the lambEOV Their thirst shall quench both from the selfsame brookEOV The giant brute before the weakly sageEOV Shall bow and men shall fear to even gazeEOV Upon the maidens that go forth aloneEOV Adorned with naught but chastity and fromEOV All lands the wisest shall revere our faithEOV He that desires our homes to plunder andEOV Sully the honour of our women himEOV Punishment terrible shall sure awaitEOV Three hundred years more and the little plotEOV Of land thou gavest shall grow and

grow safe from the storms that blowEOV And flow'rs give forth to beautify the sceneEOV Her sons shall everlasting peace enjoyEOV And blessings hitherto unknown to manEOV The grandest scene for God to

their sortsEOV The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossingEOV I with bare feet a child the wind wafting my hairEOV Listened long and longEOV Listened to keep to sing now translating the notesEOV Following you my brotherEOV Soothe soothe sootheEOV Close on its wave soothes the wave behindEOV And again another behind embracing and lapping every one closeEOV But my love soothes not me not meEOV Low hangs the moon it rose lateEOV O it is lagging O I think it is heavy with love with loveEOV O madly the sea pushes pushes upon the landEOV With love with loveEOV O night do I not see my

the earthEOV Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I wantEOV Shake out carolsEOV Solitary here the night's carolsEOV Carols of lonesome love Death's carolsEOV Carols under that lagging

husky-noised seaEOV For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to meEOV So faint I must be still be still to listenEOV But not altogether still for then she might not come immediately to meEOV Hither my loveEOV Here I am HereEOV With this just-sustained note I announce myself to youEOV This gentle call is for you my love for youEOV Do not be decoyed elsewhereEOV That is the whistle of the

near the moon drooping upon the seaEOV O troubled reflection in the seaEOV O throat O throbbing heartEOV O all and I singing uselessly uselessly all the nightEOV Yet I murmur murmur onEOV O murmurs you yourselves make me continue to sing I know not whyEOV O past O life O songs of joyEOV In the air in the woods over fieldsEOV Loved loved loved loved lovedEOV But my love no more no more with meEOV We two together no moreEOV The aria sinkingEOV All else continuing the stars shiningEOV The winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoingEOV With angry moans the fierce old Mother incessantly moaningEOV On the sands of Paumanok's shore grey and rustlingEOV The yellow half-moon enlarged sagging down drooping the face of the seaEOV almost touchingEOV The boy ecstatic with his bare feet the

the low and delicious word DEATHEOV And again Death ever Death Death DeathEOV Hissing melodious neither like the bird nor like my aroused child's heartEOV But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feetEOV Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all overEOV Death Death Death Death DeathEOV Which I do not forgetEOV But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brotherEOV That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's grey beachEOV With the thousand responsive songs at randomEOV My own songs awaked from that hourEOV And with them the key the word up from the wavesEOV The

APPEARANCESEOV Of the terrible doubt of appearancesEOV Of the uncertainty after all that we may be deludedEOV That maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after allEOV That maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable onlyEOV Maybe the things I perceive the animals plants men hills shining andEOV flowing watersEOV The skies of day and night colours densities forms Maybe these are asEOV doubtless they are only apparitions and the real something hasEOV yet to be knownEOV How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock meEOV How often I think neither I know nor any man knows aught of themEOV Maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seem asEOV from my present point of view And might prove as of course theyEOV would naught of what they appear or naught anyhow from entirelyEOV changed points of viewEOV To me these and the like of these are curiously answered by my loversEOV my dear friendsEOV When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by theEOV handEOV When the subtle air the impalpable the sense that words and reason holdEOV not surround us and pervade usEOV Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom I am silent I requireEOV nothing furtherEOV I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond theEOV graveEOV But I walk or sit indifferent I am satisfiedEOV He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied meEOV
THE FRIENDEOV Recorders ages henceEOV Come I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior I will tellEOV you what to say of meEOV Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest loverEOV The friend the lover's portrait of whom his friend his lover wasEOV fondestEOV Who was not proud of his songs but of the measureless ocean of love withinEOV him and freely poured it forthEOV Who often walked lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends his loversEOV Who pensive away from one he loved often lay sleepless and dissatisfiedEOV at nightEOV Who knew too well the sick sick dread lest the one he loved might secretlyEOV be indifferent to himEOV Whose happiest days were far away through fields in woods on hills heEOV and another wandering hand in hand they twain apart from otherEOV menEOV Who oft as he sauntered the streets curved with his arm the shoulder ofEOV his friend while the arm of his friend rested upon him alsoEOV
MEETING AGAINEOV When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been received withEOV plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for me thatEOV followedEOV And else when I caroused or when my plans were accomplished still I wasEOV not happyEOV But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health refreshedEOV singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumnEOV When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morningEOV lightEOV When I wandered alone over the beach and undressing bathed laughing withEOV the cool waters and saw the sunriseEOV And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming OEOV then I was happyEOV O then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food nourished meEOV more and the beautiful day passed wellEOV And the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came myEOV friendEOV And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowlyEOV continually up the shoresEOV I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to meEOV whispering to congratulate meEOV For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the coolEOV nightEOV In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward meEOV And his arm lay lightly around my breast and that night I was happyEOV
A DREAMEOV Of him I love day and night I dreamed I heard he was deadEOV And I dreamed I went where they had buried him I love but he was not inEOV that placeEOV And I dreamed I wandered searching among burial-places to find himEOV And I found that every place was a burial-placeEOV The houses full of life were equally full of death this house is nowEOV The streets the shipping the places of amusement the Chicago BostonEOV Philadelphia the Mannahatta were as full of the dead as of the livingEOV And fuller O vastly fuller of the dead than of the livingEOV And what I dreamed I will henceforth tell to every person and ageEOV And I stand henceforth bound to what I dreamedEOV And now I am willing to disregard burial-places and dispense with themEOV And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere evenEOV in the room where I eat or sleep I should be satisfiedEOV And if the corpse of any one I love or if my own corpse be duly renderedEOV to powder and poured in the sea I shall be satisfiedEOV Or if it be distributed to the winds I shall be satisfiedEOV
PARTING FRIENDSEOV What think you I take my pen in hand to recordEOV The battle-ship perfect-modelled majestic that I saw pass the offing to-EOV day under full sailEOV The splendours of the past day Or the splendour of the night that envelopsEOV meEOV Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me NoEOV But I record of two simple men I saw today on the pier in the midst ofEOV the crowd parting the parting of dear friendsEOV The one to remain hung on the other's neck and passionately kissed himEOV While the one to depart tightly pressed the one to remain in his armsEOV
TO A STRANGEREOV Passing stranger you do not know how longingly I look upon youEOV You must be he I was seeking or she I was seeking it comes to me as of aEOV dreamEOV I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with youEOV All is recalled as we flit by each other fluid affectionate chasteEOV maturedEOV You grew up with me were a boy with me or a girl with meEOV I ate with you and slept with you your body has become not yours onlyEOV nor left my body mine onlyEOV You give me the pleasure of your eyes face flesh as we pass you take ofEOV my beard breast hands in returnEOV I am not to speak to you I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake atEOV night aloneEOV I am to wait I do not doubt I am to meet you againEOV I am to see to it that I do not lose youEOV
OTHER LANDSEOV This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting aloneEOV It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtfulEOV It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Prussia Italy FranceEOV Spain or far far away in China or in Russia or India talkingEOV other dialectsEOV And it seems to me if I could know those men I should become attached toEOV them as I do to men in my own landsEOV O I know we should be brethren and loversEOV I know I should be happy with themEOV
ENVYEOV When I peruse the conquered fame of heroes and the victories of mightyEOV generals I do not envy the generalsEOV Nor the President in his Presidency nor the rich in his great houseEOV
But when I read of the brotherhood of lovers how it was with themEOV How through life through dangers odium unchanging long and longEOV Through youth and through middle and old age how unfaltering howEOV affectionate and faithful they wereEOV Then I am pensive I hastily put down the book and walk away filled withEOV the bitterest envyEOV
THE CITY OF FRIENDSEOV I dreamed in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole ofEOV the rest of the earthEOV I dreamed that it was the new City of FriendsEOV Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love it led the restEOV It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that cityEOV And in all their looks and wordsEOV
OUT OF THE CROWDEOV Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to meEOV Whispering I love you before long I dieEOV I have travelled a long way merely to look on you to touch youEOV For I could not die till I once looked on youEOV For I feared I might afterward lose youEOV Now we have met we have looked we are safeEOV Return in peace to the ocean my loveEOV I too am part of that ocean my love we are not so much separatedEOV Behold the great rondure the cohesion of all how perfectEOV But as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate usEOV As for an hour carrying us diverse yet cannot carry us diverse for everEOV Be not impatient a little space know you I salute the air the oceanEOV and the landEOV Every day at sundown for your dear sake my loveEOV
AMONG THE MULTITUDEEOV Among the men and women the multitudeEOV I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signsEOV Acknowledging none else not parent wife husband brother child anyEOV nearer than I amEOV Some are baffled But that one is not that one knows meEOV Ah lover and perfect equalEOV I meant that you should discover me so by my faint indirectionsEOV And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in youEOV
PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S FUNERAL HYMNEOV When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomedEOV And the great star early drooped in the western sky in the nightEOV I mournedand yet shall mourn with ever-returning springEOV O ever-returning spring trinity sure to me you bringEOV Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the westEOV And thought of him I loveEOV O powerful western fallen starEOV O shades of night O moody tearful nightEOV O great star disappeared O the black murk that hides the starEOV O cruel hands that hold me powerless O helpless soul of meEOV O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soulEOV In the door-yard fronting an old farm-house near the whitewashed palingsEOV Stands the lilac bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of richEOV greenEOV With many a pointed blossom rising delicate with the perfume strong IEOV loveEOV With every leaf a miracle and from this bush in the dooryardEOV With delicate-coloured blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich greenEOV A sprig with its flower I breakEOV In the swamp in secluded recessesEOV A shy and hidden bird is warbling a songEOV Solitary the thrushEOV The hermit withdrawn to himself avoiding the settlementsEOV Sings by himself a songEOV Song of the bleeding throatEOV Death's outlet song of life for well dear brother I knowEOV If thou wast not gifted to sing thou wouldst surely dieEOV Over the breast of the spring the land amid citiesEOV Amid lanes and through old woods where lately the violets peeped from theEOV ground spotting the greydebrisEOV Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes passing the endlessEOV grassEOV Passing the yellow-speared wheat every grain from its shroud in theEOV dark-brown fields uprisingEOV Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchardsEOV Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the graveEOV Night and day journeys a coffinEOV Coffin that passes through lanes and streetsEOV Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the landEOV With the pomp of the inlooped flags with the cities draped in blackEOV With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veiled women standingEOV With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the nightEOV With the countless torches lit with the silent sea of facesEOV and the unbared headsEOV With the waiting depot the arriving coffin and the sombre facesEOV With dirges through the night with the thousand voices rising strong andEOV solemnEOV With all the mournful voices of the dirges poured around the coffinEOV The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs Where amid these youEOV journeyEOV With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clangEOV Here coffin that slowly passesEOV I give you my sprig of lilacEOV Nor for you for one aloneEOV Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bringEOV For fresh as the morning thus would I chant a song for you O sane andEOV sacred DeathEOV All over bouquets of rosesEOV O Death I cover you over with roses and early liliesEOV But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the firstEOV Copious I break I break the sprigs from the bushesEOV With loaded arms I come pouring for youEOV For you and the coffins all of you O DeathEOV O western orb sailing the heavenEOV Now I know what you must have meant as a month since we walkedEOV As we walked up and down in the dark blue so mysticEOV As we walked in silence the transparent shadowy nightEOV As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after nightEOV As you drooped from the sky low down as if to my side while the otherEOV stars all looked onEOV As we wandered together the solemn night for something I know not whatEOV kept me from sleepEOV As the night advanced and I saw on the rim of the west ere you went howEOV full you were of woeEOV As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparentEOV nightEOV As I watched where you passed and was lost in the netherward  black of theEOV nightEOV As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank as where you sad orbEOV Concluded dropped in the night and was goneEOV Sing on there in the swampEOV O singer bashful and tender I hear your notes I hear your callEOV I hear I come presently I understand youEOV But a moment I linger for the lustrous star has detained meEOV The star my comrade departing holds and detains meEOV O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I lovedEOV And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has goneEOV And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I loveEOV Sea-winds blown from east and westEOV Blown from the Eastern Sea and blown from the Western Sea till there onEOV the prairies meetingEOV These and with these and the breath of my chantEOV I perfume the grave of him I loveEOV O what shall I hang on the chamber wallsEOV And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the wallsEOV To adorn the burial-house of him I loveEOV Pictures of growing spring and farms and homesEOV With the Fourth-month eve at sundown and the grey smoke lucid and brightEOV With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous indolent sinking sunEOV burning expanding the airEOV With the fresh sweet herbage under foot and the pale green leaves of theEOV trees prolificEOV In the distance the flowing glaze the breast of the riverEOV with a wind-dapple here and thereEOV With ranging hills on the banks with many a line against the sky andEOV shadowsEOV And the city at hand with dwellings so dense and stacks of chimneysEOV And all the scenes of life and the workshops and the workmen homewardEOV returningEOV Lo body and soul this landEOV Mighty Manhattann with spires and the sparkling and hurrying tides andEOV the shipsEOV The varied and ample land the South and the North in theEOV light Ohio's shores and flashing MissouriEOV And ever the far-spreading prairies covered with grass and cornEOV Lo the most excellent sun so calm and haughtyEOV The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezesEOV The gentle soft-born measureless lightEOV The miracle spreading bathing all the fulfilled noonEOV The coming eve delicious the welcome night and the starsEOV Over my cities shining all enveloping man and landEOV Sing on sing on you grey-brown birdEOV Sing from the swamps the recesses pour your chant from the bushesEOV Limitless out of the dusk out of the cedars and pinesEOV Sing on dearest brother warble your reedy songEOV Loud human song with voice of uttermost woeEOV O liquid and free and tenderEOV O wild and loose to my soul O wondrous singerEOV You only I hear yet the star holds me but will soon departEOV Yet the lilac with mastering odour holds meEOV Now while I sat in the day and looked forthEOV In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring and theEOV farmer preparing his cropsEOV In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forestsEOV In the heavenly aerial beauty after the perturbed winds and the stormsEOV Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing and the voices ofEOV children and womenEOV The many-moving sea-tides and I saw the ships how they sailedEOV And the summer approaching with richness and the fields all busy withEOV labourEOV And the infinite separate houses how they all went on each with its mealsEOV and minutiae of daily usagesEOV And the streets how their throbbings throbbed and the citiesEOV pent lo then and thereEOV Falling upon them all and among them all enveloping me with the restEOV Appeared the cloud appeared the long black trailEOV And I knew Death its thought and the sacred knowledge of DeathEOV And the Thought of Death close-walking the other side of meEOV And I in the middle as with companions and as holding the hands ofEOV companionsEOV I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks notEOV Down to the shores of the water the path by the swamp in the dimnessEOV To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so stillEOV And the singer so shy to the rest received meEOV The grey-brown bird I know received us Comrades threeEOV And he sang what seemed the song of Death and a verse for him I loveEOV From deep secluded recessesEOV From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so stillEOV Came the singing of the birdEOV And the charm of the singing rapt meEOV As I held as if by their hands my Comrades in the nightEOV And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the birdEOV Come lovely and soothing DeathEOV Undulate round the world serenely arriving arrivingEOV In the day in the night to all to eachEOV Sooner or later delicate DeathEOV Praised be the fathomless universeEOV For life and joy and for objects and knowledge curiousEOV And for love sweet love But praise O praise and praiseEOV For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding DeathEOV Dark Mother always gliding near with soft feetEOV Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcomeEOV Then I chant it for thee I glorify thee above allEOV I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come come unfalteringlyEOV Approach encompassing Death-strong deliveressEOV When it is so when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the deadEOV Lost in the loving floating ocean of theeEOV Laved in the flood of thy bliss O DeathEOV From me to thee glad serenadesEOV Dances for thee I propose saluting thee adornments and feastings forEOV theeEOV And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fittingEOV And life and the fields and the huge and thoughtful nightEOV The night in silence under many a starEOV The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I knowEOV And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veiled DeathEOV And the body gratefully nestling close to theeEOV Over the tree-tops I float thee a songEOV Over the rising and sinking waves over the myriad fields and the prairiesEOV wideEOV Over the dense-packed cities all and the teeming wharves and waysEOV I float this carol with joy with joy to thee O DeathEOV To the tally of my soulEOV Loud and strong kept up the grey-brown birdEOV With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the nightEOV Loud in the pines and cedars dimEOV Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfumeEOV And I with my Comrades there in the nightEOV While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosedEOV As to long panoramas of visionsEOV I saw the vision of armiesEOV And I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flagsEOV Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierced with missiles I sawEOV themEOV And carried hither and yon through the smoke and torn and bloodyEOV And at last but a few shreds of the flags left on the staffs and all inEOV silenceEOV And the staffs all splintered and brokenEOV I saw battle-corpses myriads of themEOV And the white skeletons of young men I saw themEOV I saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiersEOV But I saw they were not as was thoughtEOV They themselves were fully at rest they suffered notEOV The living remained and suffered the mother sufferedEOV And the wife and the child and the musing comrade sufferedEOV And the armies that remained sufferedEOV Passing the visions passing the nightEOV Passing unloosing the hold of my Comrades' handsEOV Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soulEOV Victorious song Death's outlet song yet varying ever-altering songEOV As low and wailing yet clear the notes rising and falling flooding theEOV nightEOV Sadly sinking and fainting as warning and warning and yet again burstingEOV with joyEOV Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heavenEOV As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recessesEOV Must I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leavesEOV Must I leave thee there in the door-yard blooming returning with springEOV Must I pass from my song for theeEOV From my gaze on thee in the west fronting the west communing with theeEOV O comrade lustrous with silver face in the nightEOV Yet each I keep and allEOV The song the wondrous chant of the grey-brown birdEOV And the tallying chant the echo aroused in my soulEOV With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woeEOV With the lilac tali and its blossoms of mastering odourEOV Comrades mine and I in the midst and their memory ever I keep for theEOV dead I loved so wellEOV For the sweetest wisest soul of all my days and lands and this for hisEOV dear sakeEOV Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soulEOV With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the birdEOV There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dimEOV

the dirt to grow from the grass I loveEOV If you want me again look for me under your boot-solesEOV You will hardly know who I am or what I meanEOV But I shall be good health to you neverthelessEOV And filter and fibre your bloodEOV Failing to fetch me at first keep encouragedEOV Missing me one place search anotherEOV I stop somewhere waiting for youEOV EOV
